# Word Chain (AI Project)
This is a class project required by Artificial Intelligence Course.

For this proramming assignment, we have to use uninformed search methods Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) to create word chains. A word chain is a sequence of valid words that differ from adjacent words on the chain by a single character. Given a start word and final word, the goal is to find a sequence, or chain, of words that link the first word to the final word.
